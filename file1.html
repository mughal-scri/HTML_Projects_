            <p><h4>THis is to demonstrate the use of Html using VSCODE:<br> HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is used to structure and organize content on a web page, serving as the foundational building block for every website. 
                Its primary uses include defining headings, paragraphs, and other elements, embedding hyperlinks to connect pages, and creating forms for user input. 
                By using HTML tags and elements, developers can specify how content like text, images, and videos should be displayed in a browser.  
            <b><br><br><h2>Core uses of HTML</h2><br></b>
            <b>Structure content:</b> <em>HTML provides the basic skeleton for a web page by defining its structure. Elements like for headings and for paragraphs are used to label different parts of the content, as shown in this W3Schools example.<br></em>
            <b>Link web pages:</b> <em>Hyperlinks are a fundamental part of HTML, allowing users to navigate between different pages on a website and between different websites.</em><br> 
            <b>Embed media:</b><em>Developers use HTML tags to embed various types of media on a page, including image</em></h4>
